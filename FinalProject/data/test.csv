7227,My husband and I cannot access the Internet on our phones or phone calls may or may not come in and we may sometimes be able to make a phone call and other times not. Texting goes the same way. We did not pick sprint in order to have no service we are paying right now for service that we don’t even receive over half the time we are at 75% down 25% up I am sitting in a parking lot accessing a company’s free Wi-Fi in order to contact you. After speaking with the technician the last time I was put through to someone that was supposed to give me a black box in order to boost our signal. That person told me that we didn’t qualify because there were no towers near Aurora Nebraska come to find out that person lied and there’s a tower 4 miles from us and 8 miles from us.￼ now I find out that the company that you are joined with has no towers in our area. What do you intend to do to fix the situation because I’m sick and tired of paying for service I don’t have￼,0

Yesterday July 11, PIN_CODE I called Sprint and spoke to a representative inquiring about unlimited data on my cellular plan. Currently my plan has 2Gs per month. Everything has been ok since I purchased my LG phone & iPad. I didn't have any type of data issue until now!!!! I asked a freakin question!!!!!!!! One question!!! I didn't have an issue or wanted to purchase anything for the moment.

After I asked the question, the representative stated that if I wanted to purchase unlimited data, what the cost for that would be. I did not ask him to take anything off or add anything on. So why in Hell when I came in tonight and my iPad says no internet??? NEVER EVER HABE I SEEN THIS MESSAGE BEFORE SO I AM EXTREMELY PISSED OFF WITH SPRINT!!!!!!!!!

The message reads:
""Cellular data plan usage""
There is no data remaining on your current plan. Would you like to add more data now? If you don't know now you can do it later in settings. 

So...Why in the hell am I getting this message? 

I've had this iPad going on two years and never ever received this message on my iPad! I used my iPad for my child's school work during the school year and summer months and for my business!!! So now what am I to do??? What in hell did this guy do to cause my internet service not to be on??? 

I need a representative or an agent to call me ASAP!!! 

I pay my bill on time and I am never late! I am so highly upset if I could cut off my service and find another service I would do so! This is unacceptable!!! 

I realize that after hours I can't speak to a rep but sometimes my business requires after hours work!
This is so wrong on many issues!

I know that Sprint has millions of customers and one customer means nothing to them but I need help now with this not in 24 or 48 hours from now!

I will try to call Sprint again in the morning and I better get some help! I can't believe they are leaving me hanging like this with some data plan usage bullshit!!!

I know no one is going to call me back on this and you probably will send  some stupid email saying that you will get back to me. But I just needed to put this in writing so that I at least tried to state my issue.",0
