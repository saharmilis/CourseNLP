9070,I am having a nightmare of an experience with your company. Back on April 24 my TV broke. You sent someone out and they determined it could not be fixed. You guys agreed to replace it. It took until June to get a new TV because the replacement TV’s you offered were sold out 3 times. I was not told this without having to call multiple times. Finally after two months without my TV you find a TV that you can get and send it out. Not as good as what I had but whatever at least I had a TV. 2 weeks later the new TV breaks. Now since July 4th I have been without a TV again. The repair company said they could fix it and contacted you to order parts. After almost 3 weeks of waiting I cal the repair company. They tell me that you are saying the parts are on back order and maybe we can get them in August. So from April to August I will have had a working TV for two weeks. This cannot possibly how your company plans to operate. I need to be given cash to go buy a TV today. This is beyond ridiculous.,0

I have contacted Sprint & I have used this option to communicate however not getting issue resolved because my mobile network does not work as it should. Not receiving messages or phone calls. I literally have to go outside to receive service. I have been a satisfied Sprint customer but now really considering on changing my services. Someone needs to reach out to me as this may not work because of mobile network. It does even work when roaming. I have tried all troubleshooting options given by phone which will hang up or disconnect from this app because of no service.,0

33556,"Hi Andrea, I'm Cody! I hope your day is going well so far, though I hate to hear that about your screen! But, not to worry, through Sprint Complete you may qualify for a discounted screen replacement. We won't be able to quote an exact price until we examine the phone in person, but some repairs start at only $30. Because of state and local closures it may be best to mail your phone in for repair right now instead of taking it into a repair center yourself, but not to worry -- all you need to do is fill out the form online at www.phoneclaim.com/sprint to get started and the rest will be handled through the mail!

If you would like to bring the phone in to one of our locations in person the process is usually quicker - often same day. Because situation change rapidly these days I do recommend checking our website before heading out to make sure your local repair shop is open. You may do so here:  https://storelocator.sprint.com/locator/",0

Your website shows that the phone has been activated but when I place a call it transfers me to an “external operator” and wants me to buy minutes. I spent at least 4 hours yesterday with 5-6 tech operators trying to get it fixed. I already pulled the SIM card and did the network reset and that has not worked. One tech told me there was a “provising delay” and I should wait a few hours and it might get cleared up. The issue has not been resolved. I need help please,0

I was also billed the $20 support fee at the time of purchase and paid that in full but was also billed this on my latest bill (this issue was just resolved) but with that being said, it’s obvious someone/thing screwed up and added insurance. Please cancel and credit my account for the insurance I did not want or authorize. Thank you.

40558,"I’ve been experiencing poorwe quality service since May 2, or 3 of 2020.
I even have an extender for better reception and to NO avail have I been provided services equaling or above my 32 years Of faithful, loyal dedication to this company.
You were with me as a young woman 29 hours away form family and friends and 1988 and I’m being rewarded with very subpar connection. I CAN NOT carry on business, medical, dentistry or personal communication at this rate. The adjoining mobile # of DIGIT_REDACTION has the same problem. At least he can rely on the government mobile phone issued to him when the need arise.
My phone conversations are interrupted by ppl not being able to heat me, to I’m breaking up, to simple being cut off or even Not even connecting.
I’m constantly checking the strength of the WiFi or the registered connection and I’m still getting subpar service.

They told me line 2538611602 wasnt used enough for them ( i called and faught it and they said they would sens it through but apparently theres issues again. Its just a cracked screen it shoulsnt be that much hassle) and for line 2538788296 they said the insurance couldnt be used for 30 days after adding which we were not informed of and does not help us.
