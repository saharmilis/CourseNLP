One of the reasons I use sprint is that it allows me to pay as I go and a huge amount of money is not due immediately. I saw there the iPhone 11 Pro Max was $45 a month for 18 mo flex lease. However today I see it’s less per month but a huge payment of $379 due up front. I would just rather cancel service if it is going to be like this. I have enjoyed Sprint but there is no way I can afford such a large up front payment. ",0

First i visited in person at a corporate sprint store, then i was told to call,  so i called and explained that i am interested in the sprint flex 9 month to buy our 3 phones of which leases expired in February and i was not made aware of that fact that since then i have been on month to month and not paying down 3 phone balances for past 5-6 months.  very dissapointing.  Plus i can no longer afford 410.00 per month due to covid.  I am a carpenter and work is slow right now and my oldest daughter begins college this fall.  I need help reducing my bill.    So this was said to sprint rep who said he would email me with step by step instructions, yet it never arrived, so i called back and re-requested this email for the 9 month plan to buy the phones, finally i recieved it and during this processed I began a live chat with a Sprint rep and explained everything once again, then she fowarded me to you, the sprint complete team of experts.  Please slay this dragon and help me once and for all.  I have been a customer for over 10 years and i am at my witts end!",0

25443,my phone for the last 10 months has bin giving me issues. I have called sprint done many updates resets and also have bin in the store multiple times and the service is still terrible most of the time I can not answer or make calls. calls drop multiple times a day.The phone is roaming for more than half the day. Every time I call i get every excuse for why my phone or service is bad.Never an answer or a solution to my problems. I pay 165.00 a monthly plus insurance for a service and phone that has not worked properly since I bought the phone and your company's solution last time I called was to tell me my service in the are is perfect and my solution is to upgrade to a new phone. why should I have to upgrade and start a payment cycle all over to fix my cell phone issue. if the phone has bin the problem from the beginning why was it never addressed or replaced. As a sprint customer I'm am paying for services that you as a company are supposed to provide. this last year my service has bin poor at best. I have made many calls complaints about this phone service with no resolve. I am very frustrated with this situation your company's tech support and customer support are very poor and rude. I have bin a customer with sprint for 5 plus years would think your and never thought I would be dealing with these issues for as long as I have. When the bill is due on the 15 of each month you want to get paid. But you never ever addressed anything of the problems I'm having just keep taking my money with no resolve to the issue. Now that this so-called merger has occurred service is even worse. Calling customer service every time talking f,0

It was explained to me that by just adding an additional $15 a month that the service and plan I have now would be extended internationally so that I could keep in touch with my family back home in the US. I only make calls to the US, and for some reason my bill is reflecting my data and it international calling uses as “X” GB/ 0 whereas my other items show international text and pictures messages “X” GB/ unlimited. Why is that? Are they not allowing me to make the calls unlimited with the additional $15 added? I asked this same question specifically to the specialist and she told me yes. But it seems as though it may be charging me additional rates for the data usage here in Qatar, and all calls back to the US. Please advise. ",0

11004,Hi there I need to send in my old device for trade in credit to apple since I got a new phone (I upgraded via apple since they had the phone I wanted) now I went to take the case off my old phone to put it in the “return kit” box to ship & noticed that the entire back lower portion of my phone is shattered! Can I schedule an appointment for tomorrow at a nearby Sprint store for the $29 repair? Or does Best Buy still provide repair services for Apple Care? I know I need to send in my device ASAP but I dont want to send it in with the back glass shattered like that??!!?! What do I need to do........??,0

33513,"Hello I want to ask generally regarding Assurance Wireless. The Unimax is full of malware, service never works period, and it's actually sometimes even impossible to charge the phones. It's not a specific phone phone issue I've had 3 same thing... Likewise same the original Unimax/Chinese small one except it could charge but unfortunately the malware always self destructed it. I know nothing would've been done prior to merger but now I have more confidence. Surely y'all could reactivate the sim if I put it in another one? Or could I at least buy a new one or something. I read if you swap out the sim before activation it will work regardless of being an assurance wireless phone. Thank you.",0
